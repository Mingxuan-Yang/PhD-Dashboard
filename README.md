# PhD Dashboard

## Introduction

A doctorate is an advanced academic degree awarded by universities that demonstrates the recipient's mastery in a certain field of study. In this project, the main goal is to solve the following problems about doctorates using `plotly` and `dash` visualization in Python. All of the doctorates in the problems were pursued in the United States.

- The number of doctorate-granting institutions and doctorate recipients over time.
- The distribution of educational resources by states in 2017.
- The debt level of doctorate recipients for each field of study over time.
- The proportion of sex and field of study for doctorate recipients over time.
- The median expected salary for doctorate recipients by employment sectors.

## Data

The dataset [PhDs awarded in the US](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data) is applied. It contains 72 tables about the demographic characteristics, educational history, sources of financial support, and postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients. Only a small fraction of the tables will be used based on the problems.
