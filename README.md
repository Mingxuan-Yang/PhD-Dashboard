# PhD Dashboard

*Project Date: 2020-11-06*

## Introduction

A doctorate is an advanced academic degree awarded by universities that demonstrates the recipient's mastery in a certain field of study. In this project, the main goal is to solve the following problems about doctorates using `plotly`, `dash` and `streamlit` visualization in Python. All of the doctorates in the problems were pursued in the United States.

- The number of doctorate-granting institutions and doctorate recipients over time.
- The distribution of educational resources by states in 2017.
- The debt level of doctorate recipients for each field of study over time.
- The proportion of sex and field of study for doctorate recipients over time.
- The median expected salary for doctorate recipients by employment sectors.

## Data

The dataset [PhDs awarded in the US](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data) is applied. It contains 72 tables about the demographic characteristics, educational history, sources of financial support, and postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients. Only a small fraction of the tables will be used based on the problems.

<!-- ## Dash Plots

- [Problem 1 plot](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~Mingxuan-Yang/6/#/)
- [Problem 2 plot](https://doctorate-distribution.herokuapp.com/)
- [Problem 3 and 4 plot](https://doctorate-characteristic-1.herokuapp.com/)
- [Problem 5 plot](https://doctorate-salary.herokuapp.com/) -->

## Streamlit Dashboard

The dashboard can be obtained by running the following code in the terminal:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This dashboard is also deployed through Streamlit Community Cloud at [this link](https://phd-dashboard-mingxuan-yang.streamlit.app/).
